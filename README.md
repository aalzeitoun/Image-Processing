Image Processing, Retrieval and Analysis
==========================================

To achieve optimization in image analysis various advance methods will not only be discussed but their quality, perfor- mance, complexity, implementation simplicity will be dis- cussed in this report. Possible usage of each technique along with advantages of a particular method w.r.t application over one another will also be explained. No doubt, computer vision is very demanding and challenging field now a days which help to solve image analysis problem in various tech- niques to achieve certain goals.But in this report we will cover only few techniques ranging from image intensities to tensor linear discriminant analysis. Gray scale image analysis will be discussed in detail using computer vision procedures as computer vision is super set of image analysis. Flow of report will move on from image quantization to wards its recogni- tion and give meaning to its features. Loly-Max algorithm is used to quantize image as well as illumination compensation techniques to illuminate it, therefore, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using single value decomposition is adopted for eigenfaces. Morever,Fisherâ€™s Linear Discriminant Analy- sis(LDA) has been used for image classification which leads to demonstrate Tensor Linear Discriminant Analysis(TLDA) for optimization and to mitigate all issues faced in conven- tional LDA. In last but not least these approaches has been compared term of performance, quality, computational speed and efficiency and not only explained with theory only but also with practical implementation to demonstrate the results which shows excellent agreement with theory and analytical results.
